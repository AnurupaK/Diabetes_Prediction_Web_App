# Diabetes Prediction Web App

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive diabetes prediction web application that uses a logistic regression model to differentiate between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Additionally, it integrates Google's Gemini model to review patient data and diagnoses, allowing users to chat with an AI doctor and generate detailed reports.

## Features

1. **Patient Data Input**: Users can input patient data, and the AI doctor will review and provide feedback.
2. **Data Validation**: If the patient parameters are absurd, the AI doctor will suggest the correct ranges.
3. **AI Doctor Chat**: Users can chat with the AI doctor for insights and reviews.
4. **Generate Report**: Users can generate a report that includes patient data, diagnosis, and the AI doctor's review.
5. **Stop Typing**: A stop button allows users to halt the AI doctor's typing if it becomes too lengthy.
6. **Future Enhancements**:
    - User login functionality.
    - Photo upload for more detailed reports.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- Google AI Studio API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes_project.git
    cd Diabetes_project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your Google AI Studio API key:
    - Go to GCP and create a project.
    - Create an API key from Google AI Studio for integrating AI into the project.
    - Save the API key in a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python Backend/app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the web app.

## Usage

1. **Input Patient Data**: Enter the patient's parameters on the left side of the UI.
2. **AI Doctor Chat**: Interact with the AI doctor on the right side for reviews and insights.
3. **Generate Report**: Click the 'Generate Report' button to get a detailed report of the patient's data, diagnosis, and AI doctor's review.

## Models and Data

- The diabetes prediction model is trained using a logistic regression algorithm.
- The dataset used for training the model is from Kaggle.

## Frontend

- The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The UI is designed to be user-friendly with a clear distinction between patient data input and AI doctor chat sections.

## Backend

- The backend is powered by Flask.
- The logistic regression model (`LogR_model.pkl`) is used for prediction.
- The AI service integrates the Google Gemini model for reviewing patient data and diagnosis.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user login functionality.
- Allow users to upload photos for more detailed reports.
